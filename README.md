# Instructions
  Copy the config.py.sample file to config.py. Proceed by replacing all of the
  credentials and project info with your own project on github.

  You will need to install a few dependencies. You can do this in a virtualenv,
  but for sake of brevity here is the pip command:

    pip install jinja2 simplejson

  Then run you should be able to just run.

    python monitor.py
